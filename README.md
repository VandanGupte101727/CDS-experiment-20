AIM:- To learn and implement sorting algorithms <br>

Software used:- VS code <br>

Theory:-<br>
Sorting algorithms arrange data in a particular order (ascending or descending) to make searching and processing more efficient. Common sorting algorithms include <br>

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. It's simple but inefficient for large datasets (O(n²) time complexity).<br>
Selection Sort: Selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element. Like Bubble Sort, it’s O(n²) in time complexity.<br>
Insertion Sort: Builds a sorted array one element at a time, inserting elements into their correct position. It’s efficient for small or partially sorted arrays with O(n²) complexity.<br>
